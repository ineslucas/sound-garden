# Touch Grass
by Inês and Ranjani

Touch Grass is a collective experience about connection to the fabric of democracy, making a play on the cultural meme & phrase "Touch Grass". As you touch grass, images related to real time news headlines start to dissipate and the projection turns into a pond with flowers and peaceful music. If you let go, the spot you were holding on to becomes noisy again with real time news titles. Coming together and getting past the noise is the only way we can make change. Concept touches on the fact that it needs multiple people to get past the noise.

More succintely, "Touch Grass" invites participants to collectively transcend the noise of real-time news by physically connecting to "grass," revealing a serene pond scene—a metaphor for unity and the transformative power of collaboration in society.
